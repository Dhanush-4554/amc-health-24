        <strong>AGNI</strong>
      </h1>
      <p class="flow-text">
        <strong><h3 style="color: black;">Introduction:</h3></strong>
        <p style="color:black">Ayurveda has described an important factor of digestion and metabolism
        in our body as Agni. Ingested food is to be digested, absorbed and
        assimilated, which is unavoidable for the maintenance of life, and is
        performed by Agni. In Ayurveda, the term “Agni” is used in the sense of
        digestion of food and metabolic products. <br /><br />
        <b>1. Agni converts food in the form of energy, which is responsible for
        all the vital functions of our body. Therefore, Ayurveda considers that
        Dehagni is the cause of life, complexion, strength, health, nourishment,
        lusture, oja, teja (energy) and prana (life energy). (Cha. Chi.
        15/3.)[1] ·</b> <br /><br />
        About the importance of Agni, Acharya Charaka has mentioned that after
        stoppage of the function of Agni, the individual dies, and when the Agni
        of an individual is sama, then that person would be absolutely healthy
        and would lead a long, happy, healthy life. But, if the Agni of a person
        is vitiated, the whole metabolism in his body would be disturbed,
        resulting in ill health and disease. Hence, Agni is said to be the base
        (moola) of life. (Cha.Chi.15/4.)[2] ·<br /><br />
        According to modern medicine, metabolic processes, division and
        multiplication are going on in all cells (dhatu paramanu) of our body
        from birth till death. The cell is the functional unit of the body.
        According to Charaka, the constituent parts of the body, if further
        divided into the atoms, are sure to become innumerable, as such cells or
        atoms are exceedingly numerous, very minute and ultrasensory. In the
        conjunction and disjunction of cells, the activating factors are Vata
        and the nature of action (Cha. sha.7/17).[3] ·<br /><br />
        In Shushruta, we can see how the “Avayavaas” are formed from “various
        dhatus” (Su.Sha.4/25-30).[4] Thus, based on Charaka and Sushruta, the
        above cells can be considered as “dhatu paramanus.” For these constant
        processes in all cells, a biological energy is constantly essential,
        without which the survival of our body will be quite impossible. The
        same biological energy is provided by Agni in Ayurveda. This
        Agni-provided biological energy in the cells (dhatu paramanu) of our
        body is of two types: potential and kinetic.<br /><br />
        <b>2. The study of Agni can be summarized according to the following
        points:</b> <br />
        <i>a] General description of Agni in various Ayurvedic texts. <br />
        b] Normal physiological function of different types of Agni. </i><br />· In
        Brahmasutra, Agni has been meant to be a sign of life in the body. Great
        value of Agni has been shown by classical literature. Acharya Yasaka has
        given the etymology of the term “Agni,” which is as follows: <br />·
        <b>Agni = A + G + Ni.</b> <br /><b>“A”</b> denotes root <b>“I,”</b> meaning <b>“to go”.</b> <br />
        <b>“G”</b> denotes the root<b> “Anja,”</b> meaning <b>“to glitter” </b>or root<b> “daha,”</b>
        meaning <b>“to burn” .</b> <br />
        <b>“Ni”</b> means <b>“to carry.”</b><br/><br />a] The etymology given by Yasaka,
        Shankaracharya (vedantasutra shabda kalpa druma) illustrates that Agni
        carries everything in it. It moves everywhere and metamorphoses
        substances, burns, assimilates, glitters and grows. Agni is a pivot
        around which the remaining factors responsible for the maintenance of
        health and causation of disease as well as decay revolve
        (Shabdakalpadrum).[5]<br /><br />
        In <b>shabdakalpa druma, 61 synonyms</b> of Agni have been compiled. These
        synonyms help in explaining the nature and functions of the Agni, e.g.,
        Vaishvanara, Sarva Paka, Tanoonpata, Amivachatana, Damunasa, Shuchi,
        Vishwambhar, Rudra etc. <b>(Shabdakalpadrum)</b>.[6]<br /><br />
        According to Acharya Sushruta, there is no existence of any other Agni
        in the body without Pitta, because when there is increased digestion and
        combustion in the body due to Ushna guna of Pitta, the treatment is like
        Agni (Su. Su. 21/09).[8] Acharya Marichi has also emphasized that the
        Agni present in the Pitta gives good or bad results when it is normal or
        vitiated (Cha. Su. 12/11).[9]<br /><br />
        Chakrapani has commented on<b> “Pittantargatta,”</b> that the function of Pitta
        inside the body is not combustion but its work is to provide heat of
        Agni. Besides this, Acharya Shusrut has described five types of Agnis as
        the variety of Pitta. Acharya Bhoj also considered Pitta as Agni,
        digestive fire is included within Agni, which is specially meant for
        different enzymatic activities of the body, i.e. pachana, deepana,
        bhedana, etc. (Chakrapani Tika on Cha.Su.-12/11).[10]<br/><br />
        According to Hemadri, Pitta is of five divisions, which are located in
        the interior of the pakvashaya and amashaya, although it is composed of
        panchabhutas. Because of an increase of (predominance qualities of)
        tejas bhuta, it is devoid of liquidity (although it is a liquid). Also,
        because it does not possess snigdha (viscidity), sita and such other
        properties of apa bhuta, it is called by the term <b>“Anala” </b>because of its
        function of paka. It cooks the food, dividing it into essence and waste
        separately. Being localized there, it bestows grace (help) to the other
        Pitta present there and also the other dhatvagni present in the dhatus
        by giving them strength (power of functioning), which is known as
        <b>“Pachaka Pitta”</b> (As.Hr.Su.12/10-12).[11]<br /><br /></p>
